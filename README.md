### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Janco Spies
I am currently a third year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. My interests include AI, statistics and bad jokes.
Why did the statistician bring a ladder to the bar?
Because they heard the drinks were on the house, and they wanted to get a good sample from the top!
